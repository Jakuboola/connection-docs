Unlike the free-form Transformations, Applications are predefined blocks with set functionality 
which can be customized or parametrized to some extent. It can be used to do 
some pretty advanced stuff like sentiment analysis, association discovery, or histogram grouping. 

Applications can also augment data (for example, add Weather or Exchange Rates) by calling on 
3rd party services to bring in additional data. All applications are implemented as extensions 
(see below) and as such can be completely created by 3rd party developers.
