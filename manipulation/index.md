Data manipulation in KBC can be done using the two following tools: 

- **Transformations** -- freeform manipulation scripts written in either SQL (for either MySQL, Redshift or Snowflake backend),
[R](https://www.r-project.org/about.html) or [Python](https://www.python.org/about/); and
- **Applications** -- representing predefined blocks with set functionality which can be customized or parameterized 
to some extent.

Both Transformations and Applications can be used in your orchestrations in exactly the same way. 
When deciding between the two, consider your capabilities, available resources and the
complexity of the task you need to perform. 

If you want to create **very complex** transformations, or need a **3rd party** to develop a transformation or application for you, 
go to [Custom Science](https://developers.keboola.com/extend/).
