This tutorial will guide you through basic usage of Keboola Connection (KBC).
A basic knowledge of [SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL) is necessary.
Before you start, make sure you have access to a (preferably empty) KBC project.
To get set up, either ask one of our partners or ping us on 
[sales@keboola.com](mailto:sales@keboola.com).
If developing KBC components is the only reason you need a project for, apply for a
[development project](https://developers.keboola.com/overview/devel-project/).

The tutorial is split into three basic parts:

- [Part 1 --- Loading Data](/tutorial/load/)
