At this juncture, you're acquainted with the swift process of loading data into Keboola, resulting in four new tables in your Storage: 
`account, opportunity, level`, and `user`. 

In this segment of the tutorial, we'll guide you through data manipulation in [Storage](/storage/tables/) using [Transformations](/transformations/). 
Our objective is to create a denormalized table from the input tables and make some minor modifications to it.

## Creating Transformation
1. To start, navigate to the Keboola **Transformations** section.

{: .image-popup}

3. Enter `Denormalize opportunities` as its name, and remember to provide a description. Transformations can be organized into folders;
you can either add it to a folder during creation or move it to any folder later. Now, enter `Opportunity` as the folder name.

Keboola transformations operate on a few fundamental building blocks. It's crucial to note that the transformation process occurs in a dedicated database schema,
meaning queries are not executed directly against your Storage tables. Instead, the system clones selected tables into the dedicated transformation schema, 
executes queries, and finally unloads created/modified objects back to the Storage.

1. [**Input Mapping**](/transformations/mappings/#input-mapping): This is where you specify the tables to be used in your transformation. In the default setup, tables not mentioned in Input Mapping cannot be used in the transformation.
2. [**Output Mapping**](/transformations/#output-mapping): This section deals with tables created or modified within your transformation. Here, you specify the tables that will be written into Storage after the successful execution of the transformation. Tables not mentioned in Output Mapping will neither be modified nor permanently stored; they are considered temporary.
3. [**Queries**](/tutorial/manipulate/#transformation-script): SQL queries define what will happen with the data. These queries take the tables from Input Mapping, modify them, and produce the tables referenced in Output Mapping. To enhance clarity, queries can be further organized into blocks.

The mapping concept serves as a crucial safeguard when manipulating your data. It ensures that there is no accidental modification of the wrong tables. The only 
tables modified by your transformation are those explicitly specified in the Output Mapping. Additionally, this concept plays a vital role in maintaining a 
detailed data lineage across your project.

### Input Mapping
Letâ€™s start with setting Input Mapping by clicking the **New Input** button.

{: .image-popup}
![Screenshot - Input Mapping](/tutorial/manipulate/input-mapping1.png)

The *Source* field in the input mapping refers to Storage. Select `in.c-csv-import.account` as the source table. You can do a full text search in the select 
field; typing `acc` will give you the table as well. In the *Table name* field, the table name `account` is automatically filled for you. This is the name of the 
source table inside the transformation. Use the **Add Input** button to create the input mapping.

Please note that there are additional settings you can configure, such as the *Changed in Last* filter, which aids in incremental processing of large tables. 
However, for the purpose of our tutorial, we won't delve into those details. See additional information about [input mapping](/transformations/mappings/#input-mapping) 
(all available options, etc.).

Add the remaining three tables: opportunity, user and level. You can add multiple tables at once:

You will get to the following configuration:

The concept of [**mapping**](/transformations/mappings) is an important safeguard
when you are manipulating your data.
Thanks to it, there is no way to modify the wrong tables by accident.
The only tables which are modified by your transformation are those explicitly specified in Output Mapping.

### Input Mapping
Let's start with setting Input Mapping by clicking the **New Input** button.

{: .image-popup}
![Screenshot - Add input mapping](/tutorial/manipulate/transformation-input.png)

The *Source* field in the input mapping refers to Storage. Select `in.c-csv-import.account` as the source table.
You can do a full text search in the select field; typing `acc` will give you the table as well.
In the *Destination* field, the table name `account` is automatically filled for you.
This is the name of the source table inside the transformation. Use the **Create Input** button to create
the input mapping.

Add the remaining three tables: `opportunity`, `user` and `level`. If you loaded data using the
[Database extractor](/tutorial/load/database/) or the [Google Drive extractor](/tutorial/load/googledrive/),
feel free to use the tables created by them (e.g., `in.c-keboola-ex-db-snowflake-548904898.account` or
`in.c-keboola-ex-google-drive-548902224.level-level`). In either case, make sure that the destinations
are set to `account`, `opportunity`, `user`, and `level`.
You will get the following configuration:

{: .image-popup}

*See additional information about [Input Mapping](/transformations/mappings/#input-mapping)
(all available options, etc.).*

### Output Mapping
Continue with setting up Output Mapping by clicking on the **New Output** button.

{: .image-popup}
![Screenshot - Add output mapping](/tutorial/manipulate/transformation-output.png)

Enter `opportunity_denorm` into the *Source* field in the output mapping;
the *Source* field refers to the transformation. This table does not exist yet.
We will create it in the transformation.

The *Destination* field refers to the name of the output table in Storage.
It will be auto-generated to `out.c-opportunity.opportunity_denorm`, which is 
perfectly fine. It will create the `opportunity_denorm` table in the `opportunity` [bucket in the output stage](/storage/tables/)
in Storage. Neither the table nor the bucket exist, but they will be created once the transformation runs.

After you finish Output Mapping, you will see this:

{: .image-popup}
![Screenshot - Output mapping result](/tutorial/manipulate/transformation-output-end.png)

The size of the `opportunity_denorm` table shows as *N/A* because the table does not exist yet.

*See additional information about [Output Mapping](/transformations/mappings/#output-mapping)
(all available options, etc.).*

### Transformation Script
To produce that table from the tables `account`, `opportunity` and `user`, write a transformation script.
To save you some time, we have already prepared the necessary SQL queries for you:

{% highlight sql %}
CREATE TABLE "tmp_level" AS
    SELECT "Name", CASE
        WHEN "Level" = 'S' THEN 'Senior'
        WHEN "Level" = 'M' THEN 'Intermediate'
        WHEN "Level" = 'J' THEN 'Junior' END AS "Level"
    FROM "level";

CREATE TABLE "tmp_opportunity" AS
    SELECT * EXCLUDE ("_timestamp"), CASE
        WHEN "Probability" < 50 THEN 'Poor'
        WHEN "Probability" < 70 THEN 'Good'
        ELSE 'Excellent' END AS "ProbabilityClass"
    FROM "opportunity";

CREATE TABLE "opportunity_denorm" AS
    SELECT "tmp_opportunity".*,
        "user"."Name" AS "UserName", "user"."Sales_Market" AS "UserSalesMarket",
        "user"."Global_Market" AS "UserGlobalMarket",
        "account"."Name" AS "AccountName", "account"."Region" AS "AccountRegion",
        "account"."Status" AS "AccountStatus", "account"."FirstOrder" AS "AccountFirstOrder"
    FROM "tmp_opportunity"
        JOIN "user" ON "tmp_opportunity"."OwnerId" = "user"."Id"
        JOIN "account" ON "tmp_opportunity"."AccountId" = "account"."Id"
        JOIN "tmp_level" ON "user"."Name" = "tmp_level"."Name";
{% endhighlight %}

In the first query, we change the user level descriptions into something more clear.

In the second query, we compute the quality level for each deal opportunity based on the estimated probability
of closing the deal.  Note that here we are excluding the system column "_timestamp" 
which appears in [cloned tables on Snowflake backend](/transformations/snowflake/#_timestamp-system-column). 

In the third query, we denormalize all four tables into a single one.
We have prepared the single table so that it will load nicely into Tableau.

## Running Transformation
Save the queries and then click on **Run Transformation**. This will create a background job which will

- get the specified tables from Storage,
- put them in a transformation database,
- execute the queries/script, and
- store the result in Storage again.

To see if the transformation job was successful, go to [**Jobs**](/management/jobs/), or click on the small
**Transformations job has been scheduled** window that pops up after a transformation starts running.

Having learned to set up a transformation, you can now

- continue with the next [Writing Data](/tutorial/write/) step, or
- take a brief side step to [Using Sandbox](/tutorial/manipulate/sandbox/).
