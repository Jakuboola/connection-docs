Welcome to the Keboola onboarding guide! Whether you've completed your proof of concept project or are stepping up 
from the [free tier](https://connection.north-europe.azure.keboola.com/wizard), this guide will help you navigate through it. 

Check out the complete overview of the Keboola platform [here](https://help.keboola.com/overview/).

## Build a Solid Foundation
We recommend starting with a good plan. It will give you a good foundation for your further work with Keboola. If your plan is smaller, 
covering one or two Keboola projects, you may not need all these steps. Here's what you might skip if that's the case:

1. [Create a Keboola Platform Usage Blueprint](#create-a-keboola-platform-usage-blueprint)
2. [Design a Multi-Project Architecture](#design-a-multi-project-architecture) (optional)
3. [Business Data Model Methodology](#business-data-model-methodology)
4. [Keboola Governance Details](#keboola-governance-details)
   
### Create a Keboola Platform Usage Blueprint
Use our [template](https://keboola.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/KB/pages/3130458213) to create a blueprint that fits your company. This includes:

- Selecting organization administrators
- Setting up a project access request system, possibly with approval steps
- Choosing main contacts
- Laying down basic rules, including naming and security guidelines

### Design a Multi-Project Architecture
This step is entirely **optional**.

Check out our guide for creating a [multi-project setup](https://keboola.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/KB/pages/2523430919), which helps organize 
data tasks across several Keboola projects.

### Business Data Model Methodology
Our Business Data Model [guide](https://keboola.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/KB/pages/3139600519/Business+Data+Model+BDM+Guide)
helps you to keep your data flexible and efficient, which is especially useful with multiple projects.
 
### Keboola Governance Details
