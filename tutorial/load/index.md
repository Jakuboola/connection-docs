There are multiple ways to load data into KBC:

1. [Manually Loading Data](/tutorial/load/manual) --- the fastest way of loading data, perfectly suited for starting
with a project, or doing any kind of [POC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_concept)

If everything goes well and the project goes to production, you will later switch to automatic
data loading using extractors.

2. [Loading data with GoogleDrive Extractor](/tutorial/load/googledrive/)
3. [Loading data with Database Extractor](/tutorial/load/database/)
4. Using other [extractors](/extractors/)

Once your data is loaded, you can take the next step --- [Data Manipulation](/tutorial/manipulate/).
