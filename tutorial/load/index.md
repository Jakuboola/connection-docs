There are multiple ways to load data into KBC:

1. [Manually Loading Data](/tutorial/load/manual)
2. [Loading data with GoogleDrive Extractor](/tutorial/load/googledrive/)
3. [Loading data with Database Extractor](/tutorial/load/database/)
4. ...

When you are starting with a project or doing any kind of [POC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_concept),
it is usually fastest to load data manually.

If everything goes well and the project goes to production, you will later switch to automatic
data loading using extractors.

Once your data is loaded, you can take the next step --- [Data Manipulation](/tutorial/manipulate/).
