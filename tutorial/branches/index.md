The feature Development Branches allows you to modify [component configurations](/components/) 
without interfering with the running configurations or entire [orchestrated pipelines](/orchestrator/).

## Tutorial
First, learn how development branches [work in general](/components/branches/).

In this tutorial, we will guide you through the process of creating and using a development branch. You will configure 
various components that demonstrate the different aspects of branches.

* Part 1 -- Preparing production configurations:
  * [Preparing table manipulating configurations](/tutorial/branches/prepare-tables/)

* Part 2 -- Working in a branch: 
  * [Working with tables in a branch](/tutorial/branches/tables-in-branch)
  * [Working with files in a branch](/tutorial/branches/files-in-branch)
* Part 3 -- Merging branches:
  * [Project diff](/tutorial/branches/project-diff/)
