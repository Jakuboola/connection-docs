In this tutorial, we will show you how to use Machine Learning Model Deployment.

## Public Beta Warning
Machine Learning (ML) Model Deployment is currently in public beta. Some features may not work as 
expected. Please bear with us and provide feedback using the feedback 
button directly in the platform or through the [feedback portal](https://ideas.keboola.com).

## Deployment Options
In the next steps, we will walk you through the process of deploying a model in your project. The model 
is deployed through an integration with the [MLflow platform](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/index.html). 
You can encounter two situations, depending on whether you need to create and register a new model, or 
whether you already have an existing model you can use. 

### New ML Model
Letâ€™s assume that you have just started exploring this feature and your ML/AI section and that no model 
has been created yet. You will see this empty screen.

{: .image-popup}
![Screenshot - No Model Yet](/transformations/ml-model-deployment/01-no-model.png)

This means that you must create an [MLflow workspace](/transformations/workspace/); continue on to the tab **Workspaces**.

{: .image-popup}
![Screenshot - Tab Workspaces](/transformations/ml-model-deployment/02-no-workspace.png)

Here you can create a new workspace. Click the green button **New Workspace** on the right, 
and select the Python MLflow workspace.

{: .image-popup}
![Screenshot - New Workspace](/transformations/ml-model-deployment/03-python-mlflow.png)

Name it, e.g., *My test workspace*, and select its backend power: *small/medium/large*. Then click 
the button **Create Workspace**.

{: .image-popup}
![Screenshot - Name Workspace](/transformations/ml-model-deployment/04-name-workspace.png)

After a while a workspace is created. You can connect to it using the generated credentials. 
JupyterLab will open, and you should find an empty Jupyter notebook, where you can place your code to use 
the MLflow server for training and registering the model. 

#### Sample code
The following code uses the [MLflow Python API](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.html#module-mlflow)
to fit an [ElasticNet](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.ElasticNet.html) 
regression model using [scikit-learn](https://sklearn.org/). At the end of the sample code, 
the model is registered to the MLflow server.

Please note that due to the beta status of the feature, we are currently supporting only MLflow version 1.24. We have recently
encountered some incompatibilities with newer libraries. To ensure full compatibility, use `mlflow==1.24` and
`numpy==1.23.4` when training models.

Once you train your model and run the first experiment, you can go back to the Keboola Connection UI, 
open the MLflow UI from there, and check the results.

{: .image-popup}
![Screenshot - Open MLflow](/transformations/ml-model-deployment/06-open-mlflow.png)

If you are satisfied, you can use a registered model for deployment. You can set the stage. 
MLflow provides [predefined stages](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/model-registry.html#transitioning-an-mlflow-models-stage) 
for common use cases such as Staging, Production, or Archived. 
You can transition a model version from one stage to another stage.

Once ready, go back to the tab **ML/AI services** in the Keboola Connection UI and deploy the model. 

### Existing ML Model
If there are already any models available (perhaps created by someone else before you), simply go to 
the tab **ML/AI Services**, click the button **Deploy Model**, select one of the already created models, 
and use it. 

The model will be deployed, and a unique endpoint URL, which you can use for sending requests, will be generated.

A successfully deployed model should look like this:

Happy experimenting!
