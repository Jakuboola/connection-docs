*AI Flow Builder is an experimental AI assistant that helps you create a simple 3-step ETL flow from end to end based on your intent. It is available exclusively in Pay-As-You-Go projects, with the primary purpose of jumpstarting the first Flow creation.* 

This version is offered free of charge as it is subject to change, and we plan to expand its functionalities in the future.

Functionality
The AI-assisted Flow Builder process is divided into three logical phases.

1. Defining the Flow Structure Based on User Intent
The user provides an intent, e.g., "I would like to analyze my marketing campaigns," and the assistant will ask additional questions about the data sources and desired destination to build the Flow structure. Once the user confirms the suggested sequence of steps (components), the Flow is created with empty configurations, and the configuration process can begin.

2. Flow Configuration
At this stage, the user gradually configures the components, starting with the first phase of the Flow (Extract). When the user clicks on a component configuration to open the configuration detail view, the assistant will guide them through the setup.

Once the component configuration is completed, the user clicks the "BACK TO FLOW" button, and the component execution starts automatically. During this period, the user can monitor the progress or proceed with configuring the remaining components within the phase.

If any errors occur, the user will be notified, and navigating to the failed component configuration will prompt the assistant to help resolve the issue.

üö® Important: The AI Flow Builder does not allow proceeding to the next Flow phase until all components are fully configured and their execution is completed successfully (indicated by a green checkmark).

3. Previewing Results
The output of a component can be previewed by clicking the "EXPLORE DATA" icon located at the bottom-right corner of the component icon.

AI Flow Builder Drafts
The user may choose to leave the AI Flow Builder before completing the Flow configuration. In such cases, the Flow is labeled as a "DRAFT", allowing the user to return later and finish the setup.

Transformation Phase
Once the Extract phase is completed, the user can proceed to configure the SQL transformation. All data from the previous phase's outputs will be automatically available in the Transformation input mapping.

The assistant will guide the user through the SQL code creation process, allowing them to ask additional questions and test the generated query until they are satisfied.

Once the transformation is completed, the outputs of this phase will be automatically used in the destination phase if configured.

Destination (Load) Phase
If a destination component was specified during the initial Flow setup, it will be included in the Flow. The setup process for this phase is similar to previous phases‚Äîthe user configures the component, and once done, it will execute when they return to the Flow.

Flow Publishing
Once all jobs in all Flow phases are successfully completed, the user can click the "PUBLISH" button. This finalizes the Flow, and the user is redirected to the standard Flow Builder, where they can set up scheduling or make additional modifications as needed.

üö® Important: Once the Flow is published, the AI Flow Builder can no longer be used for that Flow.

Limitations
1Ô∏è‚É£ Only 3-Step (Phase) Flows Are Supported
The AI Flow Builder supports Flows with up to three phases: Extract, Transform, and Load.
The Extract phase may contain multiple connectors.
The Transform phase supports only one SQL transformation configuration.
The Load phase is optional and contains a destination component. If omitted, the transformed data will be stored in Keboola Storage.
After publishing the AI-generated Flow, users can freely edit it using the standard Flow Builder, adding additional phases or configurations.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Only AI-Assisted SQL Transformations Are Supported
In the Data Processing phase, only AI-assisted SQL transformations are currently supported.
3Ô∏è‚É£ AI Flow Builder Cannot Be Used on Existing Flows
The AI Flow Builder is designed to create new Flows from scratch. It cannot be used on existing Flows.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Scheduling Can Be Set Up Only After Publishing
Flow scheduling can be configured only after the AI Flow Builder process is completed and published as a standard Flow.
5Ô∏è‚É£ Flow Structure Cannot Be Changed After Confirmation
Once the user confirms the Flow structure and components, it cannot be modified later within the AI Flow Builder. Any further modifications must be made in the standard Flow Builder.
