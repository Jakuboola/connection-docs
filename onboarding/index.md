## Build a Solid Foundation
While the excitement to dive into the implementation of your use-case is perceptible, we recommend starting your journey with thoughtful planning. 
Establishing fundamental building blocks early on will serve as a sturdy foundation throughout your entire Keboola platform experience. 
Depending on the scale of your contract, some points may not be applicable—especially if you've opted for just one or two Keboola projects. 
Some of the following steps can be skipped in such situations:

1. Create a Keboola Platform Usage Blueprint
2. Optional: Design a Multi-Project Architecture
3. Business Data Model (BDM) Methodology
