Generic Extractor is quite a special component. As its name suggests, it can **extract data from many APIs**:

- Probably any [REST (Restful) API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) 
- A lot of other APIs

Setting Generic Extractor to retrieve data from an API is a matter of writing the right **JSON configuration**. 
Because you have to write it yourself, we made the
[Generic Extractor guide](https://developers.keboola.com/extend/generic-extractor/) a part of our [Developers 
Documentation](https://developers.keboola.com/extend/). 

No other programming or software engineering skills are necessary. Even though configuring the extractor may seem quite 
complex at first, once you understand the concept, you will be able to extract desired data within (tens of) minutes. 

We strongly recommend you configure your first Generic Extractor using [our 
tutorial](https://developers.keboola.com/extend/generic-extractor/tutorial/).

To understand what specific parts of an existing configuration do, check the 
[Configuration Map](https://developers.keboola.com/extend/generic-extractor/map/).
