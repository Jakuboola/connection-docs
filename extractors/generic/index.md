Generic extractor is quite a special component. As its name suggests, it can be used to extract data from
many APIs. In fact it can extract data from probably any [REST (Restful) API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) and a lot of other APIs too.

Setting Generic Extractor to retrieve data from an API is a matter of writing a correct JSON configuration.
The configuration may seem quite complex at first sight, but once you understand the concepts, it becomes
a matter of (tens) minutes to extract the data you need. 

No programming or software engineering skills or experience are necessary to setup Generic Extractor.
Still we do consider configuring Generic Extractor as development (because you have to write JSON configuration
on your own) and therefore the guide is part of our [Developers documentation](https://developers.keboola.com/extend/generic-extractor/). If you are new, to Generic Extractor, we strongly suggest 
that you go through the [Tutorial](https://developers.keboola.com/extend/generic-extractor/tutorial/). If 
you want to understand what a specific part of an existing configuration does, you might want to 
to check the [Configuration Map](https://developers.keboola.com/extend/generic-extractor/map/).
