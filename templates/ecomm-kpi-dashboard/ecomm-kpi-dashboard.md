Utilizing eCommerce KPI dashboards powered by Shopify data provides a comprehensive **overview of critical financial metrics**, including turnover, 
orders, and customer data. These insights are presented through a **pre-defined data app dashboard** equipped with a date filter for your convenience. 

The dashboards display a comparison between planned numbers and the actual situation. Moreover, the data app facilitates effortless parameter sharing, 
enabling **seamless integration with Slack** for quick communication. 

With all your data centralized in a single table and location, the need for manual data collection across multiple systems is eliminated, 
thanks to the automated capabilities of Keboola. Simplify your data management with ease.

## Flows
The template consists of two separate flows, one for building interactive dashboards and the other for sending data into Slack.

### Building Dashboards
The first flow is for **building interactive dashboards** based on transformed data extracted from Shopify:

  - First, you will authorize the data source connector to extract data from your Shopify account. 
  - An SQL transformation will then prepare the data and create a table needed for the data app.
  - The data will then be sent into the data app, where users can view and filter it by date.

### Sending Data into Slack
The second flow is triggered once the user wants to send any of the data from the interactive dashboard **into Slack**. Then it takes over.

You will authorize the data destination component (writer), which will send outputs to Slack when users decide to share data from the dashboards.

## Entity Relationship Diagram
An entity-relationship diagram is a specialized graphic that illustrates the relationships between entities in a data destination.

## Table Description

| Name | Description |
|---|---|
| ORDER | contains data about orders, such as the last update, current price of the order, and a financial status of the given order (paid/refunded, etc.) |
| CUSTOMER | contains the ID of the last order (last_order_id) and a date stamp of the last update (updated_at) |

## Data Sources
This data source is available:

[Shopify](https://components.keboola.com/components/kds-team.ex-shopify)

## Data Destinations
The following data destination is available:

[Slack](https://slack.com/)

## How to Use Template
The process is simple. We will guide you through it, and, when needed, ask you to provide your credentials and authorize the source and destination components.

First decide which data source and which data destination you want to use. Then select the corresponding template from the **Templates** tab 
in your Keboola project. When you are done, click **+ Use Template**.

{: .image-popup}
![Add New Template](/templates/ecomm-kpi-dashboard/add-new-template.png)

This page contains information about the template. Click **+ Use Template** again.

You’ll be asked to write a name for the template instance you are about to create. You can use the template as many times as you want and still keep everything organized.

After clicking **Next Step**, you will see the template builder. Fill in all needed credentials and perform the required OAuth authorizations.

**Important:** Make sure to follow all the steps very carefully to prevent the newly created flow from failing because of any user authorization problems. 
If you are struggling with this part, go to the section [Authorizing Data Destinations](/templates/ecomm-kpi-dashboard/#authorizing-data-destinations) below.

When you are finished, click **Save** in the top right corner. The template builder will create your new configuration, and when it is done, 
you will see the newly created flow. Click **Run Template** and start building your visualizations a few minutes later.

## Authorizing Data Sources
To use a selected data source component, you must first authorize the data source. 

### Shopify

![Shopify Data Source](/templates/ecomm-kpi-dashboard/shopify-source.png)

You will be asked to provide a few details from your Shopify account to authorize the connection between Keboola and Shopify. 

First, you will need the Admin API access token, which you can easily generate using 
[Shopify's documentation](https://www.shopify.com/partners/blog/17056443-how-to-generate-a-shopify-api-token). 
The shop name can be found in the Account Settings after signing in to your Shopify account. 

Additionally, you have the option to customize the date range you wish to extract into Keboola. For more information on setting up your Shopify account, 
please refer to the [component documentation](https://components.keboola.com/components/kds-team.ex-shopify).

## Authorizing Data Destinations
Make sure to authorize the data destination.

### Slack
In order to set up the connector to Slack, you will only need to insert your [Slack Token](https://api.slack.com/authentication/token-types) 
and click **Save Configuration**.
