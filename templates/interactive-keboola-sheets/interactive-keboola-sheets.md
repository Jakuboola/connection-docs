By centralizing data editing, the app enhances collaboration, reduces errors, and streamlines your data management processes. 
Replace manual data manipulation with a seamless data editing solution. Utilizing this template will provide you with a **more efficient** and **user-friendly** 
approach to editing and managing data.

In the **Secrets** section, insert the token(s) of the bucket(s) you want to make accessible to the users 
(all tables within the bucket will then be accessible within the app). You can ignore the input and output mappings, as the app will not utilize them.

- Specify the field/column limitations within the Python code of the app.
- Deploy the app. 
- Within the data app, business users can select a table for editing.
- After completing the edits, click **Save Changes**, and the changes will instantly be saved back into the table in Keboola Storage.

## How to Use the Template
The process is simple. We will guide you through it, and, when needed, ask you to provide your credentials and authorize the destination component.

- **Save your changes:** When you are satisfied with your edits, simply click the **Send to Keboola** button. Your changes will then be saved, and the updated data will be sent back to your Keboola Storage.
