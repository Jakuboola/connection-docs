In Keboola Connection platform most of the data processing functions are implemented in **Components**. 
Components are divided into three main categories:

- [**Extractors**](/components/components/extractors/) -- used to bring data into a Keboola Connection project
- [**Writers**](/components/writers/) -- used to send processed data into a target system
- [**Applications**](/components/applications/) -- used for complex data processing.
