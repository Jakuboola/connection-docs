#### What KBC Is

KBC is a powerful data preparation platform composed of many interconnected components, 
extracting data from various sources, 
manipulating and enriching the data, and writing the results to desired Business Intelligence tools. 
It is a safe, open and extendable cloud based environment for working with your data.

#### Where to Start

If you are new to KBC and want a **brief orientation** to the Keboola ecosystem, please check out our [overview](/overview/), 
or see our [tutorial](/tutorial/) for some hands-on experience on using KBC. 

Another great way of familiarizing yourself with KBC is to scroll through 
our [presentation](kbc-intro.pdf) on both business and technical aspects of KBC, 
or to watch a [short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-VBfkV4xfc&t=62s), introducing 
all KBC components along with practical demonstrations of working with them.

If you are already familiar with how KBC works, go directly to [connection.keboola.com](https://connection.keboola.com) and log in.
