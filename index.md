## What Keboola Connection Is

Keboola Connection is a powerful data preparation platform composed of many interconnected components, 
extracting data from various sources, 
manipulating and enriching the data, and writing the results to desired Business Intelligence tools. 
It is a safe, open and extendable cloud based environment for working with your data.
