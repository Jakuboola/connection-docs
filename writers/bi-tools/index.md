Writers export data from Keboola Connection (KBC) to external systems. The following writers
allow to push data to various business intelligence platforms:

- [GoodData](/writers/bi-tools/gooddata/) --- writes tables to [GoodData](https://www.gooddata.com/) and optionally also manages the GoodData project LDM.
- [Tableau](/writers/bi-tools/tableau/) --- writes tables to [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/) TDE files which can be downloaded or uploaded to Dropbox, Google Driver or Tableau Server. You can also use [Snowflake writer](/writers/database/snowflake/) to send data into Tableau.
- [ThoughtSpot](/writers/bi-tools/thoughtspot) --- writes tables to [ThoughtSpot](https://www.thoughtspot.com/product).
- and others

A number of BI and Analytics tools is also accessible using the [Snowflake writer](/writers/database/snowflake/) using the
[Keboola Provisioned Database](/writers/database/snowflake/#using-keboola-provisioned-database), for example:

 - [Looker](/writers/database/snowflake/#connect-to-looker),
 - [PowerBI](/writers/database/snowflake/#connect-to-power-bi-desktop),
 - [Qlik](/writers/database/snowflake/#connect-to-qlik),
 - [Tableau](/writers/database/snowflake/#connect-to-tableau).
