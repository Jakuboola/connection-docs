Writers export data from Keboola Connection (KBC) to external systems. The following extractors
allow to push data to various business intelligence platforms:

- [GoodData](/writers/bi-tools/gooddata/) --- writes tables to [GoodData](https://www.gooddata.com/) and optionally also manages the GoodData project LDM.
- [Tableau](/writers/bi-tools/tableau/) --- writes tables to [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/) TDE files which can be downloaded or uploaded to Dropbox, Google Driver or Tableau Server. You can also use [Snowflake writer](/writers/database/snowflake/) to send data into Tableau.
