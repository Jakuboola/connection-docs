Writing data to GoodData is very similar to writing data to [Tableau](/writers/tableau/). 

However, there are some changes due to the fundamental differences in both platforms. 
The GoodData platform uses the concept of Logical Models where multiple tables are loaded into 
the platform together with their logical connection model (schema). KBC will assist you in creating the model.

in our Getting Started tutorial.
