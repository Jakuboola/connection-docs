Writers are [KBC components](/overview/) that take transformed and processed **output data from KBC**
and deliver it **into its final destination:** the systems and applications where the data gets used/**consumed**.

## Types of Writers
We integrate your data into most of the top market systems.
Choose the right consumption point for each project and use case. Like with Extractors,
there are **no limitations** to how and where you can send your data.

Writers can be grouped by their primary purpose:

- **Business Intelligence**: [Tableau](/writers/tableau/), [GoodData](/writers/gooddata/),
YellowFin, SAS Visual Analytics, Chartio, Periscope, Looker, and more.
- **Databases**: BigQuery, [Keboola Connection Storage](/writers/storage-api/), and more.
- **Generic Storage**: [AWS S3](/writers/storage/aws-s3/), [Dropbox](/writers/storage/dropbox/), [Google Drive](/writers/storage/google-drive/),
[Google Sheets](/writers/storage/google-sheets/), [Keboola Connection Storage](/writers/storage/storage-api/), and more.
- **Other**: Adwords Custom Audiences, Mailchimp, and more.

For a definitive list of usable writers, see your project **Writers** section.

## Working with Writers
Each writer can have multiple configurations.
Each configuration represents a combination of data and destination.

We provide tutorials on [writing into GoodData](/tutorial/write/gooddata/) and
[writing into Tableau](/tutorial/write/).
