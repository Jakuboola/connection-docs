Everything you do in KBC, must be done in KBC **Project**. Project is a basic
organizational unit in which all the work is done. Projects are grouped
into **Ogranizatons** which are assigned to **Maintainers**. A maintainer is usually 
a Keboola Partner. 

A brief overview of the project management features is available in the
corresponding part of the [Tutorial](/overview/tutorial/management/).
