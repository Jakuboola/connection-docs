The project settings page shows general information about your project.
It can be accessed from the *Users & Settings* link from the left menu:

{: .image-popup}
![Screenshot - Project Settings](/management/project/settings.png)

The settings page shows important properties of your project, such as:

- expiration,
- type of project,
- monthly fee,
- date retention for [time travel](/storage/tables/backups/)
- region.

The region of the project is the physical location of the project data. The region
corresponds to an [Amazon Region identifier](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html#concepts-available-regions). Currently two regions are available:

- us-east-1 (United States -- North Virginia)
- eu-central-1 (European Union -- Frankfurt)

On the settings page, you can:

- Rename your project
- [Export all project data](/management/project/export/)
- [Delete the project](/management/project/delete/)

Apart the settings page, there are also [Notifications](/management/account/#notifications) which
are collected from all of your projects and accessible from your
[Account page](/management/account/).
