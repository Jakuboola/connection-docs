The settings page shows important properties of your project, such as:

- Expiration
- Type of project
- Monthly fee
- Data retention for [time travel](/storage/tables/backups/)
- Region -- physical location of the project data; it corresponds to an
[Amazon Region identifier](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html#concepts-available-regions).
<br> Available regions: **us-east-1** (USA -- North Virginia), **eu-central-1** (EU -- Frankfurt)

You can also

- rename your project.
- [export all project data](/management/project/export/).
- [migrate project to another region](/management/project/migration/)

Apart from the settings page, there are also [Notifications](/management/account/#notifications) available. To access these
important messages collected from all of your projects, go to your [Account page](/management/account/), or click the bell on
the right of the top menu.
