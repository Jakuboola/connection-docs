In Keboola, customers are provided with three levels of detail on telemetry data and two ways to use it. 
The first option is the [Telemetry Data connector](/components/extractors/other/telemetry-data/), which is used to get the raw data for further analysis. 
Another option is [Telemetry dashboards](/management/telemetry/telemetry-dashboards), which are available in Keboola projects after clicking on the profile picture in the top right corner.

Three modes are available for data and visual form: Project mode, Organization mode, and Activity Center mode. More details on raw data modes can be found in these links:

- [Organization mode](/components/extractors/other/telemetry-data/#organization-mode-tables)
- [Activity Center mode](/components/extractors/other/telemetry-data/#activity-center-mode-tables)

For the visual part, you can go to [Telemetry Dashboards](/management/telemetry/telemetry-dashboards).
