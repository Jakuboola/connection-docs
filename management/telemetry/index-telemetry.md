In Keboola there are three levels of detail that are provided to customers on telemetry data and two ways these can be used. 
The first option is [Telemetry Data connector](/components/extractors/other/telemetry-data/) that is used to get the raw data to further analysis. 
Another option are [Telemetry dashboards](/management/telemetry/telemetry-dashboards) that are available in Keboola projects after click in the profile picture in the top right corner.

For both, data and visual form, there are three modes available - Project mode, Organization mode and Activity Center. More details on raw data modes can be found in these links: 
- [Project mode](/components/extractors/other/telemetry-data/#project-mode-tables)
- [Organization mode](/components/extractors/other/telemetry-data/#organization-mode-tables)
- [Activity Center mode](/components/extractors/other/telemetry-data/#activity-center-mode-tables)

For the visual part, you can go to [Telemetry Dashboards](/management/telemetry/telemetry-dashboards).
