Organizations are containers for [KBC Projects](/management/#project-status). Depending on your contract
details and permissions, the organizations feature may or may not be available to you.

To see the organization a project is assigned to, go to **Users & Settings** --- the 
**Settings** tab:

{: .image-popup}
![Screenshot - Project Settings](/management/organization/project-detail.png)

Or, go to **Account Settings** to see all organizations you are a member of.

{: .image-popup}
![Screenshot - Organizations](/management/organization/organization-1.png)

**Note:** If you do not see the `Organizations` section in your account settings, 
you are not a member of any organization.

Each organization is assigned to a **Maintainer** (either Keboola or Keboola Partner). 
A maintainer is also primarily responsible for L1 support (unless agreed otherwise). 

Each member of an organization is a full member and can **add and remove other members**.

- Newly added members get an email confirmation. 
If they do not have a KBC account, they are [invited to create one](/management/users/#new-user).
- Removed members will receive an email notification. After leaving an organization, 
you cannot go back unless someone invites you again.

As an organization member, you can leave/re-enter all existing projects in the organization. 
You can also **create new projects**. To do so, click the *New Project* button:

{: .image-popup}

Enter the project name and select *project template*. Project templates differ mainly in the project 
expiration time. 
Some templates may be subject to billing. 

Apart from managing organization users, projects and billing information, all organization members can
also manage [shared buckets](/storage/buckets/sharing/).
