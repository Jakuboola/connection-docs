Organizations are containers for [KBC Projects](/management/#project-status). Depending on your contract
details and permissions, the organizations feature may or may not be available to you.

To view to which organization a project is assigned, you can go either to **Users & Settings** and on the 
**Settings** tab, you will project settings:

Or you can go to **Account Settings** to see all organizations you are member of.

Note: If you don't see the `Organizations` section in your account settings, you are not a member of any organization.
Each organization is assigned to a **Maintainer**. A Maintainer is either Keboola or Keboola Partner. Maintainer is 
also primarily responsible for L1 support (unless agreed otherwise). 

Each member of the organization is a full member and can add or remove other members. If you add a new member, 
she will get an email confirmation. If she does not have a KBC account, she will be 
[invited to create one](/management/users/#new-user).
If you remove a member, she will receive an email notification. If you leave an organization, you cannot go back
until someone invites you again.

Organization members can also create new projects and enter and leave all existing projects in the organization.
When you leave a project in the organization you can always enter it. To create a new project, click the *New Project* button:

Enter a project name and select *project template*. Project templates differ mainly in the expiration time 
of project. Some templates may be subject to billing. 

Apart from managing organization users, projects and billing information, all members of organization can
also manage [shared buckets](/storage/buckets/sharing/).
