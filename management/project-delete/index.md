It is possible to entirely delete your project. 

To do so, go to **Users & Settings** and select the **Settings** tab. Then click the **Delete Project** button. 
The project deletion actually only marks a project for deletion and, for some time, does no other changes to it.

Once the project is marked for deletion, it enters a **60-day grace period** during which it cannot 
be accessed and all project operations, such as data loads and orchestrations, are stopped.

During the grace period, a request for undeleting the project can be sent to our [Support](mailto:support@keboola.com). 
However, the deletion will become irreversible after the time expires, and the project along with any associated data will be gone for good.

We strongly suggest you make a [backup of your project](/management/project-export/) before deleting it. 

**Important**: Expiring projects will be deleted automatically when the expiration day is due. 
You will receive a notification a week in advance. 
When an expired project is deleted, the same grace period rules will apply as if it was deleted manually.
