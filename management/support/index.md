### Obtaining Support
There are multiple ways to obtain support from within your project.
First and foremost, there is a **Support** link in the navigation on the left. Click it and fill in a form 
to create a ticket, which will reach your maintainer.

Secondly, if you happen to trigger a server error while working with Keboola Connection, there will be 
a button to contact our support in the error alert message.

### Keboola Support Users
In order to solve an issue or gain context regarding an application error, a technical support member 
may require access to your project. By default, Keboola support staff may join your project when 
requested, and they will appear in the member's list marked by the Keboola badge:

Keboola support members will always have MFA enabled, their accounts always expire, and they are 
required to have a reason to enter the project. They also do not count towards the project limits.

### Require Approval for Support Access
Some organizations may prefer to have a starker demarcation for their projects with regard to access by 
the support team. To facilitate this transparency, we have introduced the option to require approval for 
all temporary access by Keboola support accounts.
The setting can be found in the [organization details](/management/organization/) on the **Account 
Settings** page:

To disable auto join and require approval for support accounts, click the **Change** link to open 
the dialog, and uncheck the **Auto Join** checkbox.

The description for support access will reflect the current setting.

With auto join off, a joining support account will require approval by an existing project member in 
order to gain access. When a support member requests access, each active project member will receive an 
email notification:

{: .image-popup}

The requesting user will appear in the user's list as shown below. Any active project member can use 
the links provided in the requesting user's row to either approve or reject the application for access.
